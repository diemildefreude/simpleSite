# simpleSite

This was a front-end exercise and my first attempt at making a website based on a design document. The design documents for the mobile and desktop version are found here in the designDocs folder. Font and color values are derived directly from there, while some other proportional/size values are estimated. The mobile menu is shown in the design document and was thus left to my discretion. Only html/css and js are used and the only js is for opening and closing the mobile menu.
